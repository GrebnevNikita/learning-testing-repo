# What is a container?
A container is an isolated environment for your code.
This means that a container has no knowledge of your operating system,
or your files. It runs on the environment provided to you by Docker Desktop.
Containers have everything that your code needs in order to run, down to 
a base operating system. You can use Docker Desktop to manage and explore 
your containers.  


cd /path/to/welcome-to-docker/

docker build -t welcome-to-docker .  

In the previous command, the -t flag tags your image with a name, welcome-to-docker in this case
